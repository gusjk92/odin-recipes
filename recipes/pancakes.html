    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>A family favorite recipe for <em>fluffy</em>, chocolate chip pancakes.  Add as many chocolate chips as you like.  Serve with maple syrup.  <strong>Enjoy!</strong></p>

    <p>Note: You can also sprinkle the chocolate chips on top instead of folding them into the batter.  Instead of chocolate chips, you can add sprinkles, blueberries, strawberries or other flavored chips.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup mils</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white vinegar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/2 cup miniature chocolate chips, or more to taste</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine milk and vinegar in a bowl and set aside for 5 minutes to "sour" the milk.</li>
        <li>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Whisk egg, butter and vanilla extract into "soured" milk until well combined.  Pour flour mixture into the wet ingredients and whisk until just combined.  Fold in chocolate chips.  Batter will be thick.  Allow batter to rest for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-low heat, and coat with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Pour about 1/4 cup of batter for each pancake onto the skillet.  Cook until bubbles appear on the surface, 2 to 4 minutes.  Flip pancake with a spatula, and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 more minutes.  Repeat with remaining batter.  Serve immediately.</li>

    </ol>
